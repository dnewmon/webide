WebIDE
======

A web-based code editor.

Installation:

 * Configure $PROJECT_PATH (each sub-folder will be a separate "project")
 * Configure $WHITELISTED_PATHS to secure access to the system
 * Login using: username / password (api.php:163)
 * Press Control + Space to access nearly all functions of the editor.
 * Press Control + , to access settings of the editor itself.

You can edit the WebIDE using the WebIDE editor.  Be careful when doing this though.
You should keep 2 editors open (one for coding, and one for testing).  If anything 
breaks you should be able to fix it and re-save. If you break api.php, run panic.php once.
